      "a1": "A Shell Chest is a \"loot\" box that randomly generates equipment that can be applied to (worn by) your Otto NFT. Each Shell Chest contains one piece of wearable equipment. Each Shell Chest generates one of over several hundred different pieces of equipment. Get a Shell Chest to see what kind of cool, powerful equipment awaits your Otto!",
      "a2": "Silver Chests are the least expensive  and offer the most common equipment types. Gold Shell Chests have rarer equipment, and Diamond Chests are the most expensive option, but provide the greatest chance of getting the rarest equipment available. To view a more comprehensive breakdown of the equipment rarity probability by chest, go [here](https://docs.ottopia.app/ottopia/gameplay/store#what-does-a-shell-chest-contain).",
      "a3": "Equipping your Otto NFT with items generated by Shell Chests is one of the best and easiest ways to strengthen your Ottos - the 1st generation citizens of Ottopia. The equipment found in Shell Chests improves the overall health and strength of your Otto NFT by increasing its rarity score, among other things. The rarer the item your Otto is equipped with, the more competitive you are in the rarity competition(s) and the higher the likelihood your Otto will be able to win future missions and earn CLAM!\n\nTo learn more about the functionality of equipment, please read the [Whitepaper](https://docs.ottopia.app/ottopia/)",
      "a4": "There are only 5,000 Portals available, which means only 5,000 Otto NFTs can enter the Otterverse. When you mint a Portal in Ottopia, you are effectively buying an Otto NFT.\n\nYou will be given between 1 and 8 different Otto candidates to choose from. Then, all you need to do is summon your favorite Otto to join us in the Otterverse!\n\nOne portal costs 50 CLAMs. [Mint your Portal now>](/mint)",
      "a5": "In Otter Kindgom, we use CLAM as the formal currency, so you must have some CLAM tokens in your wallet!\nNote: CLAM that have been staked or deposited into Pearl Chests cannot be used.\n\nHow to buy CLAM? check this page: [How to Buy and Stake CLAM](https://docs.ottopia.app/treasury/tutorials/how-to-buy-and-stake-clam)",
      "a6": "Each wallet address can get one Shell Chest.\nShell Chests are also NFTs, so you can sell it or buy it in the external NFT market.\nIf you want more Shell Chests, you can also purchase them in the Ottopia Store. There is no maximum number of Shell Chests that can be purchased.",
